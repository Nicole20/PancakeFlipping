PancakeFlipping
===============

This is a super simple idea of just flipping a pancake. This focuses more on the animation part of Unity.

Unity Objects
=============

- Two Cylinders (Pancake and Pan)
- Two Cubes (Stove and Pan's handle)
- One Directional Light (Sun)
- One Camera

Unity Components
================

Add the Flip.js to the pan and FlipPancake.js to the pancake.
Add animations to the pan and the pancake.
Add any textures and any skybox you'd like.

Unity Animations
================

The animation for the pan changes rotation in the z axis. In half a second, the rotation changes from 0 to 10. The rotation changes from 10 back down to 0 in half a second. The animation is one second long.
The animation for the pancake changes the rotation in the z axis and the position in the y axis. In three quarders of a second, the position changes from 6 to 16. In the next three quarders of a second, the postion goes back down to 6. In the total 1 and a half seconds of the animation, the rotaion goes from 0 to 360.
